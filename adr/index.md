# ðŸ§­ Architecture Decision Records (ADR) â€” Guide & CLI Tutorial

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) document **key technical and architectural decisions**, the reasoning behind them, and their consequences.  
They provide a transparent and lightweight way to ensure that decisions are understood, traceable, and evolve with your system.

## ðŸ’¡ Best Practices

âœ… Keep each ADR about one clear decision.
âœ… Capture reasoning, trade-offs, and alternatives â€” not just the conclusion.
âœ… Record decisions when they happen â€” not retroactively.
âœ… Use clear statuses: Draft â†’ Proposed â†’ Accepted â†’ Superseded.
âœ… Link related ADRs using related:, supersedes:, and superseded_by: fields.
âœ… Never delete ADRs â€” supersede them to preserve history.
âœ… Use pull requests for discussion and approval.
âœ… Keep ADRs concise and easy to read.
âœ… Store supporting diagrams or assets next to the ADR file if needed.
âœ… Treat ADRs as code â€” reviewed, versioned, and published.

## Why ADR
Architecture knowledge often disappears into slides, chats, and memory. 
When teams or technologies change, context is lost, and decisions are repeated or contradicted.

> **Good architecture isnâ€™t about getting every decision right â€” itâ€™s about making the reasoning visible.**

ADRs ensure:
â€¢ Transparency â€” everyone knows why choices were made.
â€¢ Continuity â€” new team members understand the reasoning.
â€¢ Accountability â€” clear ownership and decision status.
â€¢ Traceability â€” decisions can be followed over time.

The goal is informed decisions â€” not discussions.

## CLI Tutorial
We use Log4brains to create, preview, and publish ADRs easily.
Each ADR is a simple Markdown file, managed in version control and published as a static site.



### Create a New ADR
```bash
cd adr
npx -y log4brains@latest adr new
