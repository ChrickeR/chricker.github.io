Finding the right angle to address a problem can be tricky. It's important to understand the context and identify the boundaries of what needs to be done. That's why it's essential to **zoom in and out** in order to get a better perspective.

When you *zoom in*, you focus on a particular aspect of the problem and its immediate environment. You define the context — understanding what needs to be done and how it fits within the wider scope. You need this level of detail when designing a specific solution or refining implementation requirements.

Once that context is clear, zooming out again helps you see how everything connects as part of a larger system. It reveals dependencies, friction points, and opportunities for optimization. This allows you to create more effective solutions designed with their environment in mind from day one instead of retrofitting later.

**Zooming in and out** gives both overview and precision — a dual perspective that leads to smarter, more resilient outcomes.
