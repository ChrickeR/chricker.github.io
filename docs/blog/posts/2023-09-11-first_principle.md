In the arena of creative problem-solving and innovation, "First Principle" acts as a guiding star, leading us to deconstruct complex problems to their most fundamental truths. This approach enables individuals to question assumptions, break free from traditional norms, and craft innovative solutions. Possessing this mindset is indispensable in the field of digital transformation. 

While this may not be groundbreaking information for many of you, it's worth emphasizing. Based on my experience, achieving this can be quite challenging. In this blog post, we will explore the core concept of First Principles Thinking and draw inspiration from some historical examples.

**Understanding First Principle**

First Principle Thinking is an age-old strategy, harnessed by great thinkers throughout history. It revolves around the concept of dissecting complex problems into their most basic components, with a focus on the core truths that underpin them. This methodology encourages us to look beyond existing solutions and explore uncharted territories of innovation.

**Challenging the Conventional Wisdom**

The limitations of conventional wisdom often confine us to incremental improvements rather than true paradigm shifts. Consider the historical anecdote of "faster horses" in the context of transportation. Instead of envisioning the automobile, people were fixated on making horses run longer and faster.

**Navigating First Principle**

In a world that values specialization and sticking to the basics, it's important to understand why applying first principle can be challenging.

I recently read David Epstein's book, "Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World," which sheds a interesting light on this.

Epstein explains that our natural tendency to see patterns can be both a strength and a weakness. It helps us, but it can also make us too rigid in our thinking.

Additionally, Epstein highlights how being too specialized can limit our ability to adapt to new or complex problems. It narrows our perspective.

That teaches us that while first principle are valuable, we must balance them with an open-minded approach that embraces diverse thinking. To apply first principles effectively, we need to recognize and overcome our biases and be willing to explore different perspectives.

We must therefore encourage us to cultivate a broader, more adaptable mindset to find effective solutions.

**Disrupted Healthcare with a Fresh Perspective**

10 years ago I attended a remarkable session featuring the founders of "Kry," the innovative Swedish online doctor service. Their story revealed an intriguing twist - their success was, in part, due to their lack of traditional medical backgrounds.

In an industry where expertise was deemed paramount, their unconventional approach defied conventional wisdom. 

However, the founders' outsider perspective became their strength. Unburdened by conventional thinking, they challenged the norm and developed innovative solutions. Their journey transformed "Kry" into a pioneer, redefining how healthcare is accessed online.

Their story serves as a reminder that outsiders can often make the greatest impact by daring to question established norms and redefine what’s possible.

**A Revolutionary Leap: The V-Style in Ski Jumping**

Let's venture into the world of sports with an exemplary tale of Jan Boklöv, the pioneer who defied conventions. Inspired by First Principles Thinking, Boklöv raised fundamental questions about ski jumping: "What defines ski jumping at its core? What are the fundamental elements involved?"

As he broke down the problem, Boklöv identified the critical factor of minimizing air resistance to maximize flight distance. This profound insight gave birth to the V-style, where ski jumpers spread their skis in a V shape to reduce drag and soar to greater distances. The introduction of the V-style revolutionized ski jumping, challenging the established norms and pushing the boundaries of what was previously deemed possible.

**Culinary Precision: The Sous Vide Method**

First Principles Thinking extends its reach far beyond sports, encompassing a multitude of domains, including the culinary world. Picture the conventional method of cooking, reliant on the temperature of a flame or heat source. By questioning this traditional approach, chefs asked: "What are the fundamental principles of cooking? What are the core elements involved?"

By dissecting the problem, they pinpointed precise temperature control as a fundamental element. This insight led to the creation of the sous vide method, where food is vacuum-sealed and cooked at an exact temperature in a water bath. This culinary innovation opened new horizons of precision cooking and flavor.

**How to Apply First Principles Thinking**

First Principles Thinking can be applied universally. Here's how to set it in motion:

Define the problem: Begin by articulating the challenge you seek to address, whether it's in technology, sports, cooking, or another realm.

Break it down: Deconstruct the problem into its fundamental components or truths.

Question assumptions: Challenge any assumptions that may constrain your thinking.

Seek alternatives: Explore novel ideas and solutions that emerge when you approach the problem from its foundational elements.

Iterate and refine: Continuously hone your understanding and solutions as you gather additional information and insights.

First Principles Thinking is a potent tool for catalyzing creative problem-solving and innovation. By daring to question the status quo, dissecting problems into their core truths, and exploring fresh solutions, we can transcend the confines of conventional thinking. Whether you're a seasoned professional, an aspiring innovator, or simply inquisitive, the might of First Principles Thinking can embolden you to unlock creativity and reimagine solutions across diverse domains. It's a mindset that encourages us to envision "automobiles" instead of settling for "faster horses" and empowers us to tread uncharted paths of innovation, much like Jan Boklöv did with the revolutionary V-style in ski jumping.

If you've already read the preceding post about [The Power of Models and Business Capabilities](https://troi.se/posts/models/) and now have a firm grasp of "What we do," perhaps your next logical step is to apply First-principle. 

Find the key business capability that makes a difference, and then apply first-principle thinking to explore the transformative potential it holds.
