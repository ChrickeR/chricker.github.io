The teams where staffed by self selection with no management interferance. The process in short, the product owner first pitch their product and then every individual by them self selected the product they wanted to work with. We did this in close cooperation with product management and was a big step in the digialization journey.<br><br>The archiecture team had daily close contact with the teams and in most cases also a team member to drive the solution against the target architecture using the guiding principles.<br><br>## Audits<br><br>The architecture team also supported internal and external auditors to guide them in solutions and documentation.<br><br><br>## Data protection and GDPR<br><br>The architecture team also supported the data protection function and business domains around process development, implementation and implementation of processes linked to data protection.<br><br>And ofcourse we did al lot more :)</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on August 6, 2024</p><div class="post__share-tag-container"><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button icon" aria-label="Share button"><i class="fas fa-share-alt"></i></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://troi.se/authors/christoffer-rasten/" class="invert" rel="author">Christoffer Råsten</a></h3><p>This blog is a platform for me to share my knowledge and experience of Enterprise and Software Engineering.
