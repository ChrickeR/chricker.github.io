ThoughtWorks Technology Radar is a great tool for keeping up to date on the latest trends in technology and the industry. This is an invaluable resource for any organization, especially those looking to stay ahead of the curve in terms of new and emerging technologies. The radar provides a comprehensive overview of the latest technologies, trends, and strategies that are currently seen as important or innovative in the industry.

The Technology Radar is split into four different categories: Adopt, Trial, Assess, and Hold. It provides an easy way to evaluate the current state of a technology, as well as how it is likely to evolve in the future. This helps organizations make better decisions about the technologies they should invest in, and those they should avoid.

The Adopt section of the radar includes technologies that are mature enough to be used in a production environment. This includes technologies that are stable, well tested, and have a wide range of applications. Technologies in this section are considered to be worth investing in and are recommended for organizations looking to make use of them.

The Trial section includes technologies that are still quite new, but are well worth exploring. This could include emerging technologies that may be risky, but have potential for great rewards. The Assess section includes technologies that may have potential, but have not yet been proven in a production environment.

Finally, the Hold section includes technologies that are not yet ready for adoption, or are not considered to be important. This could include technologies that are still in the early stages of development, or those that are not seen as important to the organization.

In conclusion, ThoughtWorks Technology Radar is a great tool for staying up to date on the latest technologies and trends. It provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of technology and helps organizations make better decisions when it comes to investing in new technologies.

Every six months or so, Thoughtworks publishes its Technology Radar.

If you think this is a good idea, you can [create one](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/byor) for your organization.

Here is an example how Zalando has done it´s own [tech radar](https://opensource.zalando.com/tech-radar/).
