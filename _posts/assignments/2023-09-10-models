excerpt: 'The Power of Models and Business Capabilities'

In the world of architecture, a significant part of our work revolves around achieving alignment and consensus. To reach this common ground and facilitate discussions, we rely heavily on various types of models.Creating a model or map is akin to crafting a tool to understand and simplify a complex reality. To truly comprehend something, we need to see the connections within it. To make these connections clear, we must simplify, highlight certain aspects, and downplay others. One particular tool that has gained prominence, or at least frequent mention, is the capability map, which directs our attention to what our company or organization does. It's an easy topic of discussion with different parts of the business because it doesn't contain solutions and technology but elevates the discussion to another level. I have been involved in developing these maps and even transformed them into a card game used in planning meetings, sparking conversations within an operationally-oriented organization about tactical moves and goals. These discussions are essential if we are to genuinely confront the ongoing transformation in society, often referred to as digitalization.

The Art of Creating Understanding

As architects, our primary goal is to design structures and systems that function seamlessly and efficiently. However, achieving this isn't always straightforward, especially when you're dealing with multifaceted challenges that require collaboration and consensus among diverse stakeholders.

This is where the power of models and maps comes into play. Think of them as a cartographer's tools, helping us navigate the complex landscapes of business and technology. Just as a map simplifies a sprawling terrain into manageable proportions, models distill intricate realities into comprehensible concepts.

The Essence of Models

When we create a model or map, we're essentially crafting a lens through which we can view and dissect a complex reality. These models serve multiple purposes:

Simplification: Complex problems often involve numerous interrelated components. Models allow us to simplify these complexities, highlighting the most critical elements while temporarily setting aside others.

Highlighting Relationships: Models enable us to identify and visualize connections and dependencies within a system. This helps stakeholders grasp the bigger picture and how different parts of an organization fit together.

Facilitating Discussions: Models provide a common language for discussions. They transcend technical jargon and allow people from different backgrounds and departments to engage in meaningful conversations.

Alignment and Consensus: Achieving alignment and consensus is often the primary goal. Models create a shared understanding, reducing misunderstandings and conflicts.

Understanding Business Capabilities

Before we dive into the "angel" of business capabilities, let's clarify what we mean by it. A business capability defines “what” a business does at its core. This differs from “how” things are done or where they are done. Business capabilities are the core of the business architecture

The Rise of Capability Maps

One model that has gained prominence in recent years is the capability map. It's a tool that shifts the focus from "how" an organization operates to "what" it does. This shift is crucial, especially in the age of digital transformation, where adaptability and innovation are paramount.

Capability maps don't delve into specific solutions or technologies but rather serve as a high-level guide. They outline the core functions and activities of an organization, providing a foundation for strategic discussions. By elevating the conversation to this level, organizations can better prepare themselves to navigate the ongoing digital revolution.

Turning Maps into Games: A Creative Approach

I've had the privilege of participating in the creation of capability maps and even transforming them into interactive tools. One such iteration was turning a capability map into a card game that we used during planning meetings. This innovative approach transformed a highly operational and solution-oriented organization into one that discussed tactical maneuvers and long-term goals.

The card game acted as a bridge between the abstract world of capability mapping and the practical needs of the organization. It prompted discussions about strategic moves and future visions. Such discussions are crucial if we are to effectively address the ongoing transformation in society, often referred to as digitalization.

In Conclusion

In the journey of digital transformation, it's easy to get lost in the technicalities of systems and processes. However, by keeping the "angel" of business capabilities at the forefront, you not only stay grounded in your company's essence but also remain open to the limitless possibilities that the digital age offers.

So, the next time you embark on a digital transformation initiative, remember to embrace the "angel" of business capabilities. Start with the "what" before delving into the "how." In doing so, you'll find that your journey becomes more purposeful, adaptable, and ultimately, successful.
