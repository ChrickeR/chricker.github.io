The other packages will just call this core API, they will contain fewer business rules as possible. As we are not so sure about the features we will provide in the future, this is good for extensibility.\n- Yarn + Lerna seems to be a very good practice used by a lot of other open-source projects to publish npm packages.\n\n## Links <!-- optional -->\n\n- [A Beginner's Guide to Lerna with Yarn Workspaces](https://medium.com/@jsilvax/a-workflow-guide-for-lerna-with-yarn-workspaces-60f97481149d)\n- [Step by Step Guide to create a Typescript Monorepo with Yarn Workspaces and Lerna](https://blog.usejournal.com/step-by-step-guide-to-create-a-typescript-monorepo-with-yarn-workspaces-and-lerna-a8ed530ecd6d)\n"},"creationDate":"2020-09-25T16:34:23.000Z","lastEditDate":"2020-09-25T16:34:23.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"Thomas Vaillant","publicationDate":"2020-09-25T21:59:59.000Z","file":{"relativePath":"docs/adr/20200925-multi-packages-architecture-in-a-monorepo-with-yarn-and-lerna.md","absolutePath":"/Users/thomas/git/log4brains/docs/adr/20200925-multi-packages-architecture-in-a-monorepo-with-yarn-and-lerna.md"},"repository":{"provider":"github","viewUrl":"https://github.com/thomvaill/log4brains/blob/master/docs/adr/20200925-multi-packages-architecture-in-a-monorepo-with-yarn-and-lerna.md"}},"l4bVersion":"1.1.0"},"__N_SSG":true}
