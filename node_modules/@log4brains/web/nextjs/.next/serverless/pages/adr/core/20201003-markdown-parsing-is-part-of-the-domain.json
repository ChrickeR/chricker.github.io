It won't be possible to switch to another format easily in the future\n"},"creationDate":"2020-09-25T16:34:23.000Z","lastEditDate":"2020-09-25T16:34:23.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"Thomas Vaillant","publicationDate":"2020-10-03T21:59:59.000Z","file":{"relativePath":"packages/core/docs/adr/20201003-markdown-parsing-is-part-of-the-domain.md","absolutePath":"/Users/thomas/git/log4brains/packages/core/docs/adr/20201003-markdown-parsing-is-part-of-the-domain.md"},"repository":{"provider":"github","viewUrl":"https://github.com/thomvaill/log4brains/blob/master/packages/core/docs/adr/20201003-markdown-parsing-is-part-of-the-domain.md"}},"l4bVersion":"1.1.0"},"__N_SSG":true}
